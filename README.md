# SalesGPT

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **context-aware** Sales AI agent using LLMs.

It demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. 

SalesGPT can understand what section of a sales conversation (e.g., introduction, qualification, objection handling) is it at and act accordingly.

We leverage the LangChain library in this implementation and are inspired by BabyAGI [Link].

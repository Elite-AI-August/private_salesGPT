# SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant

This repo demonstrates an implementation of a **context-aware** AI Sales Assistant using LLMs.

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly:

    - Introduction
    - Qualification, objection handling) 


We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .

For questions, [contact the notebook author](mailto:filipmichalsky@gmail.com).


## How to Use

To get a feel for a conversation with the AI Sales agent, you can run:

`python automate_sales.py`

from your terminal.

make sure you environment is using Python 3.10+ and `requirements.txt` are installed.
